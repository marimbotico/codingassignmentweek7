/*Now, let's see what sum += numbers[i]; does in a loop:

Initialization: At the beginning, we set sum to zero. It's like having an empty basket.

Looping through the numbers: The loop starts from the first number in the list (numbers[0]), which is 1. It picks up the number and adds it to the basket (sum). So now, sum becomes 1 (since it was zero and we added 1).

Next number: Now, the loop moves to the next number (numbers[1]), which is 3. It adds 3 to whatever is already in the basket (sum). So now, sum becomes 1 + 3 = 4.

Continuing the process: The loop continues this process until it reaches the end of the list. It picks each number, adds it to what's already in the basket (sum), and updates sum accordingly.

So, in the end, sum will contain the total of all the numbers in the list. It's like counting all the candies in your bag and putting them in a basket.*/
